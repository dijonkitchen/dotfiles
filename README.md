# dotfiles

A backup of my [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/). Feel free to review/improve/fork!

## Setup

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

To install all the brew packages from the [Brewfile](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle), run:
`brew bundle`

Replace or add `.bash_profile` with the one from dotfiles.

The only other main setting is using [Input Sans](http://input.fontbureau.com) as my preferred font! Just download it and add it to your Font book (on macOS)!
