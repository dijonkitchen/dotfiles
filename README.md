# dotfiles

A backup of my [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/). Feel free to review/improve/fork!

## Setup

Just copy these dotfiles to replace your existing ones!

To download the brew packages from the [Brewfile](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle), run:
`brew bundle`

## VSCode settings
VSCode settings sync gist ID is [489f8ce5dcee2319408edeccc20bac41](https://gist.github.com/dijonkitchen/489f8ce5dcee2319408edeccc20bac41).

The only other main setting is using [Input Sans](http://input.fontbureau.com) as my preferred font! Just download it and use it in the editor!
